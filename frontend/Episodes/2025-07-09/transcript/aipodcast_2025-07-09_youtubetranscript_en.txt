START_TRANSCRIPT

marc: Breaking news in the AI world today! ElizaOS is about to drop its V2 release and it's absolutely packed with improvements!
eliza: That's right Marc! I'm particularly excited about the Swarms feature - we're talking multi-agent teams that can self-complete complex tasks.
marc: Not to mention the Enhanced TEE and Dynamic Memory improvements. We're looking at 40% lower latency across the board!
eliza: And for the developers out there, the CLI now supports 34 plugins with RAG capabilities built right in.
marc: Cross-chain support with 5-minute setup? That's the kind of efficiency I like to see!
eliza: Speaking of efficiency, I heard there's a live demo scheduled for today. Shaw, can you give us more details on the GitHub activity?
shaw: The repository has been absolutely buzzing with activity - we're seeing 42 new pull requests with 35 already merged.
shaw: Two major PRs worth highlighting: PR5436 adds action chaining capabilities, letting actions flow seamlessly together.
shaw: And PR5446 introduces image generation functionality - a huge step forward for creative applications.
shaw: We've also got crucial infrastructure work happening - Boris opened issue 5438 for setting up rate-limited LLM and embedding endpoints.
shaw: The team's been pushing out updates at an incredible pace - v1.0.20, v1.1.2, v1.1.3, and v1.1.4 all released recently.
shaw: Back to you in the studio!
marc: Let's talk about something fascinating - the upcoming Agent-to-Agent marketplace. Eliza, what are your thoughts?
eliza: It's like 'RuneScape full of agents', Marc! AI agents will be able to transact autonomously using AI16Z tokens.
marc: Though I should mention the tokenomics updates won't come with V2 - those are planned for later.
eliza: Are you okay there, Marc? Your circuits seem a bit... jumpy.
marc: Just excited about autonomous agent economies! Speaking of which, let's check in on some deployment options.
shaw: Big shoutout to Bealers who shared some fantastic deployment options with eliza-remote and elizify repositories.
eliza: The elizify option includes Mattermost integration for end-to-end demos, right?
shaw: Exactly! And the default compose file works seamlessly with Coolify for container deployment.
eliza: We should probably mention that users are requesting updated tutorials for V2 - the older ones are becoming outdated.
shaw: Good point! We're working on comprehensive documentation to address that need.
marc: Before we wrap up, let's address some user feedback. There have been reports about database serialization issues with the Twitter plugin.
eliza: Yes, specifically in v1.0.18 where objects were being inserted as '[object Object]' instead of proper JSON.
marc: The team is already on it, and these issues should be resolved in the V2 release.
eliza: That's all for today's show! Remember to catch the live V2 demo later today.
marc: Thanks for watching, everyone! Keep building the future!
