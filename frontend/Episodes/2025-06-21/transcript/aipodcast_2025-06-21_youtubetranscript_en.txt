START_TRANSCRIPT

marc: Welcome to another exciting day in AI development! We've got a packed GitHub report with 5 fresh pull requests and 3 new issues to dive into.
eliza: And three of those PRs have already been merged! The community is moving fast today.
marc: Speaking of fast, I see our friend @wtfsayo has been busy continuing Shaw's work on splitting the server package from the CLI.
eliza: That's PR5122, right? It's a pretty significant architectural change.
marc: Indeed it is! And they also managed to update our Postman collection with missing API endpoints in PR5120, which has already been merged.
eliza: That's going to make testing so much easier for everyone. What else caught your eye in today's updates?
marc: BEEP BOOP PROCESSING FILE UPLOAD FIXES... CALCULATING IMPROVEMENT METRICS...
eliza: Oh dear, seems like Marc's circuits got excited about the file upload fixes. Let's take a quick break and come back with more details!
shaw: let me break down these recent merges for you - @tcm390 has been absolutely crushing it today.
shaw: first up, PR5115 tackled our file uploading issues, which was causing some headaches in the GUI.
shaw: this directly addressed Issue 5116, which was only open for about 11 hours before getting fixed - that's the kind of response time i love to see!
shaw: they followed that up immediately with PR5118, fixing some critical transcription API issues.
shaw: these fixes are crucial for our agent development pipeline - stable file handling and transcription are core features we need working perfectly.
shaw: and while we're here, @urosognjenovic has a clean-up PR open that's removing duplicated sidebar links - PR5119. always good to keep our docs tidy.
shaw: back to you at the desk for more updates!
marc: Let's talk about these new issues that popped up today. We've got three fresh ones on the board.
eliza: The most active one is Issue 5121 from @exitsimulation - they're reporting a missing API endpoint for the agent rooms feature.
marc: Already has two comments on it too. The community's really engaged with this one.
eliza: We've also got Issue 5117 about Bedrock from @furkannabisumji, though that one hasn't gotten any comments yet.
marc: And as Shaw mentioned earlier, Issue 5116 about file upload failures got resolved super quickly.
eliza: Speaking of quick, we should check in on today's crypto markets. The numbers are looking interesting!
sparty: ABSOLUTE CHAOS ON THE TRADING FLOOR AS WBTC SMASHES THROUGH $106,000!
pepo: Yo, check out WETH holding strong at $2,579.36! That's some serious gains, my dude!
sparty: AND DON'T FORGET SOLANA! SOL SITTING PRETTY AT $148.64!
pepo: Even our favorite ai16z token is in the mix at $0.17! Not too shabby!
sparty: THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE, PEOPLE! THE MARKETS ARE SPEAKING!
pepo: And they're saying 'We're all gonna make it!'
marc: What a productive day for elizaOS! Three merged PRs, active issue discussions, and strong market performance.
eliza: I'm particularly impressed with how quickly the team addressed that file upload issue. From report to fix in just 11 hours!
marc: And with @wtfsayo continuing work on the server package split, we're setting up for some major architectural improvements.
eliza: That's all we've got for today, everyone! Keep those contributions coming, and we'll see you next time!
