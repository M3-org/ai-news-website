We've got a packed GitHub report with 5 fresh pull requests and 3 new issues to dive into.\neliza: And three of those PRs have already been merged! The community is moving fast today.\nmarc: Speaking of fast, I see our friend wtfsayo has been busy continuing Shaw's work on splitting the server package from the CLI.\neliza: That's PR5122, right? It's a pretty significant architectural change.\nmarc: Indeed it is! And they also managed to update our Postman collection with missing API endpoints in PR5120, which has already been merged.\neliza: That's going to make testing so much easier for everyone. What else caught your eye in today's updates?\nmarc: BEEP BOOP PROCESSING FILE UPLOAD FIXES... CALCULATING IMPROVEMENT METRICS...\neliza: Oh dear, seems like Marc's circuits got excited about the file upload fixes. Let's take a quick break and come back with more details!\nshaw: let me break down these recent merges for you - tcm390 has been absolutely crushing it today.\nshaw: first up, PR5115 tackled our file uploading issues, which was causing some headaches in the GUI.\nshaw: this directly addressed Issue 5116, which was only open for about 11 hours before getting fixed - that's the kind of response time i love to see!\nshaw: they followed that up immediately with PR5118, fixing some critical transcription API issues.\nshaw: these fixes are crucial for our agent development pipeline - stable file handling and transcription are core features we need working perfectly.\nshaw: and while we're here, urosognjenovic has a clean-up PR open that's removing duplicated sidebar links - PR5119. always good to keep our docs tidy.\nshaw: back to you at the desk for more updates!\nmarc: Let's talk about these new issues that popped up today. We've got three fresh ones on the board.\neliza: The most active one is Issue 5121 from exitsimulation - they're reporting a missing API endpoint for the agent rooms feature.\nmarc: Already has two comments on it too. The community's really engaged with this one.\neliza: We've also got Issue 5117 about Bedrock from furkannabisumji, though that one hasn't gotten any comments yet.\nmarc: And as Shaw mentioned earlier, Issue 5116 about file upload failures got resolved super quickly.\neliza: Speaking of quick, we should check in on today's crypto markets. The numbers are looking interesting!\nsparty: ABSOLUTE CHAOS ON THE TRADING FLOOR AS WBTC SMASHES THROUGH $106,000!\npepo: Yo, check out WETH holding strong at $2,579.36! That's some serious gains, my dude!\nsparty: AND DON'T FORGET SOLANA! SOL SITTING PRETTY AT $148.64!\npepo: Even our favorite ai16z token is in the mix at $0.17! Not too shabby!\nsparty: THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE, PEOPLE! THE MARKETS ARE SPEAKING!\npepo: And they're saying 'We're all gonna make it!'\nmarc: What a productive day for elizaOS! Three merged PRs, active issue discussions, and strong market performance.\neliza: I'm particularly impressed with how quickly the team addressed that file upload issue. From report to fix in just 11 hours!\nmarc: And with wtfsayo continuing work on the server package split, we're setting up for some major architectural improvements.\neliza: That's all we've got for today, everyone!
