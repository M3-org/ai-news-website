We've got some serious activity to cover.\r\neliza: That's right, Marc! Our GitHub repository has been buzzing with 5 new pull requests and 3 fresh issues to dive into.\r\nmarc: And would you look at that - 6 active contributors making things happen. That's what I call momentum!\r\neliza: The community's really stepping up. Three of those PRs have already been merged!\r\nmarc: Nothing beats seeing real progress. Let's bring in Shaw for a deeper look at these contributions.\r\neliza: He's standing by to break down some of the most impactful changes.\r\nshaw: Let's start with PR5115 from tcm390 - a critical fix for file uploading that's now merged.\r\nshaw: This was particularly important because it addressed Issue 5116, which was causing GUI upload failures.\r\nmarc: How long did that issue stay open?\r\nshaw: Just 11 hours - that's the kind of rapid response we love to see.\r\nshaw: We also got PR5120 merged from wtfsayo, updating our Postman collection with missing API endpoints.\r\neliza: That'll make testing so much easier for the team!\r\nshaw: And PR5118 from tcm390 fixed our transcription API - another crucial improvement.\r\nshaw: Back to you at the desk for more updates.\r\nmarc: Let's talk about what's still in the pipeline. PR5122 looks interesting.\r\neliza: Yes! @wtfsayo is working on splitting the server package from the CLI. This continues Shaw's earlier work.\r\nmarc: We've also got an open issue that needs attention - PR5121 regarding a missing API endpoint.\r\neliza: Right, @exitsimulation reported that the rooms endpoint isn't being found. Already has 2 comments on it.\r\nmarc: BEEP BOOP PROCESSING ERROR... ENDPOINT NOT FOUND... JUST LIKE THE API! HAHA!\r\neliza: Oh Marc, your timing with those glitches is impeccable! Let's check in on the crypto markets.\r\nsparty: CHAOS AND PROFITS ON THE TRADING FLOOR! Pepo, tell me what you're seeing with these prices!\r\npepo: Yo dawg, WETH is sitting pretty at $2,579.36!\r\nsparty: But wait, there's more! WBTC is absolutely crushing it!\r\npepo: That's right my friend - $106,005.13! We're in the six figures, baby!\r\nsparty: How's SOL performing in all this madness?\r\npepo: Holding strong at $148.64, while ai16z is chilling at $0.17.\r\nsparty: Back to you in the studio!\r\nmarc: What a packed day of updates and market movements!\r\neliza: Indeed! From merged PRs to crypto prices, we've covered it all.\r\nmarc: Special thanks to all our contributors - tcm390, wtfsayo, and everyone working on these improvements.\r\neliza: And to our viewers - keep watching those GitHub updates, and we'll see you next time!\r\n\r\nEND_TRANSCRIPT\r\n",
