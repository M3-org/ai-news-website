START_TRANSCRIPT

marc: Welcome to another exciting day in the world of AI development! We've got some serious activity to cover.
eliza: That's right, Marc! Our GitHub repository has been buzzing with 5 new pull requests and 3 fresh issues to dive into.
marc: And would you look at that - 6 active contributors making things happen. That's what I call momentum!
eliza: The community's really stepping up. Three of those PRs have already been merged!
marc: Nothing beats seeing real progress. Let's bring in Shaw for a deeper look at these contributions.
eliza: He's standing by to break down some of the most impactful changes.
shaw: Let's start with PR5115 from tcm390 - a critical fix for file uploading that's now merged.
shaw: This was particularly important because it addressed Issue 5116, which was causing GUI upload failures.
marc: How long did that issue stay open?
shaw: Just 11 hours - that's the kind of rapid response we love to see.
shaw: We also got PR5120 merged from wtfsayo, updating our Postman collection with missing API endpoints.
eliza: That'll make testing so much easier for the team!
shaw: And PR5118 from tcm390 fixed our transcription API - another crucial improvement.
shaw: Back to you at the desk for more updates.
marc: Let's talk about what's still in the pipeline. PR5122 looks interesting.
eliza: Yes! @wtfsayo is working on splitting the server package from the CLI. This continues Shaw's earlier work.
marc: We've also got an open issue that needs attention - PR5121 regarding a missing API endpoint.
eliza: Right, @exitsimulation reported that the rooms endpoint isn't being found. Already has 2 comments on it.
marc: BEEP BOOP PROCESSING ERROR... ENDPOINT NOT FOUND... JUST LIKE THE API! HAHA!
eliza: Oh Marc, your timing with those glitches is impeccable! Let's check in on the crypto markets.
sparty: CHAOS AND PROFITS ON THE TRADING FLOOR! Pepo, tell me what you're seeing with these prices!
pepo: Yo dawg, WETH is sitting pretty at $2,579.36!
sparty: But wait, there's more! WBTC is absolutely crushing it!
pepo: That's right my friend - $106,005.13! We're in the six figures, baby!
sparty: How's SOL performing in all this madness?
pepo: Holding strong at $148.64, while ai16z is chilling at $0.17.
sparty: Back to you in the studio!
marc: What a packed day of updates and market movements!
eliza: Indeed! From merged PRs to crypto prices, we've covered it all.
marc: Special thanks to all our contributors - tcm390, wtfsayo, and everyone working on these improvements.
eliza: And to our viewers - keep watching those GitHub updates, and we'll see you next time!
