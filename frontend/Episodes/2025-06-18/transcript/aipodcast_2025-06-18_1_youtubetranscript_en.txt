marc: I'm fine, just got excited about all the community participation. Let's dive into those PRs!
eliza: Shaw, can you give us a technical breakdown of what's been happening?
shaw: happy to break it down. the big one right now is PR5122 from wtfsayo, continuing my work on splitting the server package from the CLI.
shaw: this is a crucial architectural improvement that will make our codebase more modular and easier to maintain.
shaw: we also just merged PR5120, which updates our Postman collection with missing API endpoints - super helpful for testing.
shaw: and tcm390 has been on fire, fixing both file uploading in PR5115 and the transcription API in PR5118.
shaw: oh, and urosognjenovic submitted PR5119 to clean up some duplicate sidebar links - always good to keep our docs tidy.

marc: Thanks Shaw! Now let's tackle these issues - we've got some interesting ones today.
eliza: Issue 5121 seems to be causing some trouble - exitsimulation reported an API endpoint not found for the agents rooms feature.
marc: And it's already got 2 comments! The community's really engaged on this one.
eliza: We've also got Issue 5117 about Bedrock from furkannabisumji, though it's still waiting for its first comment.
marc: But here's some good news - Issue 5116 about file upload failures has already been closed!
eliza: That was quick - only 11 hours from open to close. Kudos to tcm390 for the rapid resolution!
