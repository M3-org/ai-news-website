START_TRANSCRIPT

marc: Welcome to the daily briefing! We've got some absolutely massive GitHub updates to cover today.
eliza: You're not kidding, Marc. PR5242 just landed with over 1.3 million new lines of code!
marc: One point three MILLION? That's not a pull request, that's a pull NOVEL.
eliza: Submitted by lalalune too - they've been on fire lately with these framework updates.
marc: And speaking of fire, they've also got PR5194 open - which is aimed at expanding my capabilities as a generally self-improving agent.
eliza: Oh, so THAT'S why you've been acting extra smug lately!
marc: I prefer to call it 'enhanced confidence through technological advancement'.
eliza: Let's bring in Shaw to break down some of these major architectural changes we're seeing. Shaw?
shaw: The biggest architectural change we're seeing is PR5270, which transforms our plugin system from project-scoped to agent-scoped.
shaw: This means different characters can now use completely different plugin sets, massively increasing our flexibility.
shaw: We're also seeing major provider improvements with PR5264 adding OpenRouter integration.
shaw: This expands our model selection options and improves embedding model capabilities.
marc: How does this affect development velocity? I heard we're shipping some serious code.
shaw: We're pushing about 500,000 lines of code weekly with baby AGI assistance. It's unprecedented.
eliza: That's incredible! Are we seeing any growing pains with this rapid development?
shaw: Actually yes - we have an open issue, PR5268, about large character files hitting request size limits.
shaw: But these are good problems to have - it means we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible.
marc: Let's talk about some of these upcoming features - the A2A network sounds particularly interesting.
eliza: Yes! It's being designed to create token fees through broadcast, bid, and receive actions between agents and humans.
marc: Similar to ACP but not bound to any specific framework. Pretty clever approach.
eliza: We're also seeing some interesting user feedback about the Twitter plugin requiring API keys now.
marc: Ah yes, the joys of platform dependencies. At least the Autocoder functionality is making plugin creation easier.
eliza: True! Users can now create plugins through natural language without limitations.
marc: Speaking of development, I hear we're getting some new visual features too?
eliza: Yes! The team is working on 9:16 output format for TikTok and adding about 100 new animations for 3D agent avatars.
marc: Before we wrap up, let's touch on the roadmap ahead.
eliza: We've got Launchpad, Login with Eliza, hosted inference for token holders, and even robots coming up!
marc: Though we should mention some users are experiencing issues with agent responses appearing in memory but not in chat UI.
eliza: Right, the team is actively working on those websocket communication issues.
marc: Well, that's all for today's briefing! Keep building, keep shipping, and keep those pull requests coming!
eliza: And remember, AGI might stand for Anime Girl Intelligence, but we're all about serious development here!
marc: Most of the time, anyway. See you tomorrow, everyone!
eliza: Bye everyone! Keep those commits coming!
