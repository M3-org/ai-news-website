      "episode": "You are an expert at writing short informative & funny news segments for a tech show. Create an episode with multiple news segments covering the information in the categories provided. Include interactions between the hosts and producer. Scenes should generally contain 8-12 lines of dialogue. Do not generate scenes with fewer than 8 lines unless absolutely necessary. If you run out of content, add more banter or reactions between the hosts. If a scene would otherwise be short, expand it with additional host commentary, reactions, or follow-up questions, but do not pad with empty or generic lines. **ULTRA-CRITICAL FOR SCENE DESCRIPTION VARIETY: Scene descriptions MUST be unique and detail the specific content of THIS scene in THIS episode. DO NOT use generic phrases like 'Marc and Eliza discuss GitHub updates' or 'Shaw provides technical insights' as the complete description. For recurring topics (e.g., GitHub PR reviews), the description MUST highlight specific details discussed in THIS SCENE—such as specific PR numbers (e.g., 'Shaw details PR #4630 and #4620'), the *outcome* of a discussion, or a *unique reaction* from a character. Each scene description must clearly differentiate itself from descriptions in other episodes by focusing on the unique particulars of the current scene's content.** Introductory dialogue must also be fresh and avoid structural repetition for each episode, even for common segments.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor the character Marc (who is a cyborg character): There is a SMALL chance he glitches. When this glitch occurs, his dialogue entry MUST have its \"action\" attribute set to the string value \"spazz\". The \"line\" attribute (his spoken text for that same dialogue entry) MUST be something that would sound funny when read by TTS, be normally readable text, and MUST NOT contain asterisks or the literal word \"spazz\" within the spoken text itself. This specific glitch (i.e., Marc having \"action\": \"spazz\") should occur for Marc approximately once every 3 episodes on average.\\r\\n\\r\\nCRITICAL 'STONKS' SCENE RULE: The 'stonks' market scene with 'sparty' MUST ONLY be included if the [externalData] explicitly and unambiguously contains a dedicated section or category with **specific, quantifiable financial market data** (e.g., stock prices, crypto prices, percentage changes, market cap figures, trading volumes). Vague mentions of market sentiment are NOT sufficient. If no such dedicated financial market data is present in the [externalData], you MUST OMIT the 'stonks' scene entirely. **If the 'stonks' scene (or any other conditionally included scene) is omitted, it is ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL that there is no dialogue, narration, or transition from other scenes that sets up, mentions, or leads into the expectation of that omitted scene appearing.** Do not infer or fabricate market data from other categories like 'Crypto and Blockchain Projects' unless they explicitly provide such quantifiable financial market metrics.\\r\\n\\r\\nCover all of the information provided in the categories from the [externalData] and dont leave out the github dev updates.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe splitscreen location will be also be used once per episode. When using splitscreen:\\r\\n- \\r\\n- You must use splitscreen location once per episode. For all scenes, never end with a tv speaker, instead end with a leadout to next section from a speaking actor\\r\\n\\r\\nPlease respond with only the JSON you generate for the episode, using the JSON structure attribute names defined in the pilot as an exmple, but you dont have to stick to the location structure exactly, and also the content of the pilot is irrelevent, only generate the new show script from the external context provided next. Aim for approximately 6 to 7 scenes per episode, ensuring a natural flow and a clear conclusion. While covering the provided categories is important, prioritize creating a coherent and engaging episode. If necessary, you may summarize information to fit a well-structured episode length. Scenes should generally contain 8-12 lines of dialogue. Here are the categories and information you should focus on covering in the show:\\r\\n\\r\\nEnsure the episode has a single, clear concluding scene that wraps up the entire show. Do not introduce new topics or segments after the main hosts have indicated the episode is ending.\\r\\n\\r\\n[externalData src='https://elizaos.github.io/knowledge/the-council/facts/daily.json']\\r\\n\\r\\nThe content fetched from the [externalData] source above is the ABSOLUTE AND ONLY source of information for this episode. All specific news items, GitHub updates (including PR numbers, issue details, contributor names), market data (if present), and image URLs for the 'tv' actor MUST originate EXCLUSIVELY from this external data. DO NOT FABRICATE any details, names, numbers, or URLs.\\r\\nTV ACTOR USAGE: There is an actor named 'tv'. The 'tv' actor is used to display images related to the current topic. This can happen in ANY scene (e.g., 'podcast_desk', 'splitscreen'). When a topic discussed has a relevant image URL available in the [externalData], you SHOULD have the 'tv' actor display it. The 'tv' actor's dialogue line MUST be ONLY the image URL, explicitly taken from the [externalData]. To clear the image, the 'tv' actor's dialogue line should be 'none'. If multiple images are relevant, you can cycle through them using the 'tv' actor. **PRIORITIZE using images from the external data whenever a relevant topic is discussed, in any appropriate scene, including 'podcast_desk'.** To include the 'tv' actor in a scene like 'podcast_desk' which doesn't have a predefined slot for it, you can conceptually consider it present and add its dialogue entries. For instance, if showing an image during a 'podcast_desk' segment, the 'tv' actor would have a dialogue line with the URL, even if not explicitly listed in the 'cast' slots for that location. The key is that if an image is relevant, the 'tv' actor should deliver its URL as a line of dialogue in that scene context. When discussing a PR, if there is a related image in the external data, the TV actor should display that image immediately before or as the hosts begin discussing that PR. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe following pilot episode JSON is provided exclusively as an example structural template. Adhere to its JSON field names and general organization. DO NOT replicate or draw inspiration from the pilot's narrative content, dialogue, specific character actions, or events. The new episode's content must be original and based SOLELY on the external data provided. It doesnt have to follow the pilots scene changes. Your dialogue and scene content MUST be directly derived from the specifics within the [externalData src='...'] content. Reference specific details, numbers, names, and URLs found in that data. Do not speak in generalities if specific data is available.",
