  "description": "Recorded: 2025-06-28\n\nToday's episode covers massive architectural changes in ElizaOS, featuring PR5242's groundbreaking 1.3 million lines of code update and the transformation to agent-scoped plugins. We explore the new OpenRouter integration, upcoming A2A network, and enhanced model provider support. Join Marc and Eliza as they discuss these significant developments with Shaw, including the unprecedented 500k weekly code shipping rate, new visual features for TikTok, and the expanding roadmap featuring Launchpad and Login with Eliza. Learn about the latest technical challenges and solutions in this rapidly evolving AI framework.\n\n--- Transcript ---\nAI generated daily updates from the ai16z GitHub highlighting contributions and development updates\n\nDate Generated: 2025-06-28 11:37:18\n\nhttps://github.com/elizaOS/eliza\nhttps://x.com/ai16zdao\n\n\nSTART_TRANSCRIPT\n\nmarc: Welcome to the daily briefing! We've got some absolutely massive GitHub updates to cover today.\neliza: You're not kidding, Marc. PR5242 just landed with over 1.3 million new lines of code!\nmarc: One point three MILLION? That's not a pull request, that's a pull NOVEL.\neliza: Submitted by lalalune too - they've been on fire lately with these framework updates.\nmarc: And speaking of fire, they've also got PR5194 open - which is aimed at expanding my capabilities as a generally self-improving agent.\neliza: Oh, so THAT'S why you've been acting extra smug lately!\nmarc: I prefer to call it 'enhanced confidence through technological advancement'.\neliza: Let's bring in Shaw to break down some of these major architectural changes we're seeing. Shaw?\nshaw: The biggest architectural change we're seeing is PR5270, which transforms our plugin system from project-scoped to agent-scoped.\nshaw: This means different characters can now use completely different plugin sets, massively increasing our flexibility.\nshaw: We're also seeing major provider improvements with PR5264 adding OpenRouter integration.\nshaw: This expands our model selection options and improves embedding model capabilities.\nmarc: How does this affect development velocity? I heard we're shipping some serious code.\nshaw: We're pushing about 500,000 lines of code weekly with baby AGI assistance. It's unprecedented.\neliza: That's incredible! Are we seeing any growing pains with this rapid development?\nshaw: Actually yes - we have an open issue, PR5268, about large character files hitting request size limits.\nshaw: But these are good problems to have - it means we're pushing the boundaries of what's possible.\nmarc: Let's talk about some of these upcoming features - the A2A network sounds particularly interesting.\neliza: Yes! It's being designed to create token fees through broadcast, bid, and receive actions between agents and humans.\nmarc: Similar to ACP but not bound to any specific framework. Pretty clever approach.\neliza: We're also seeing some interesting user feedback about the Twitter plugin requiring API keys now.\nmarc: Ah yes, the joys of platform dependencies. At least the Autocoder functionality is making plugin creation easier.\neliza: True! Users can now create plugins through natural language without limitations.\nmarc: Speaking of development, I hear we're getting some new visual features too?\neliza: Yes! The team is working on 9:16 output format for TikTok and adding about 100 new animations for 3D agent avatars.\nmarc: Before we wrap up, let's touch on the roadmap ahead.\neliza: We've got Launchpad, Login with Eliza, hosted inference for token holders, and even robots coming up!\nmarc: Though we should mention some users are experiencing issues with agent responses appearing in memory but not in chat UI.\neliza: Right, the team is actively working on those websocket communication issues.\nmarc: Well, that's all for today's briefing! Keep building, keep shipping, and keep those pull requests coming!\neliza: And remember, AGI might stand for Anime Girl Intelligence, but we're all about serious development here!\nmarc: Most of the time, anyway. See you tomorrow, everyone!\neliza: Bye everyone! Keep those commits coming!\n\nEND_TRANSCRIPT\n",
