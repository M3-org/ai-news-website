We've got some major architectural changes to discuss today.\r\neliza: That's right Marc! PR5122 just landed with a huge improvement - splitting the server package from the CLI.\r\nmarc: Wtfsayo really knocked it out of the park with this one, continuing Shaw's earlier work on modularization.\r\neliza: It's a significant step forward for maintainability. Speaking of which, should we bring in Shaw for more technical details?\r\nmarc: Absolutely! Shaw's been instrumental in this architectural evolution. Let's get his insights.\r\neliza: Shaw, can you join us and break down what this server package separation means for developers?\r\nshaw: Happy to dive in. The server package separation is a game-changer for our architecture.\r\nshaw: PR5122 maintains backward compatibility while giving developers more flexibility in how they implement the server components.\r\nshaw: And right on its heels, PR5125 from lalalune added comprehensive tests across multiple packages.\r\nshaw: We're talking over 62,000 lines added to core, server, project-starter, and plugin-starter packages.\r\nshaw: This level of testing coverage is crucial as we continue expanding our plugin ecosystem.\r\nmarc: Speaking of plugins, we should address some of the recent challenges users have been facing.\r\nshaw: Absolutely. Let's break down the current plugin issues we're tracking.\r\nmarc: We've got some serious plugin issues to address. Issue 5004 highlighted problems with the knowledge management RAG functionality.\r\neliza: Yes, and Issue 5017 is showing that plugin action callbacks aren't making it to user responses in chat.\r\nmarc: These issues suggest we might need a deeper review of our plugin architecture.\r\neliza: Users are also reporting problems with agent responsiveness and action selection defaulting to REPLY instead of more appropriate actions.\r\nmarc: Let's bring Shaw back in to discuss how we're addressing these challenges.\r\nshaw: The plugin issues we're seeing are growing pains as we scale the framework's capabilities.\r\neliza: How are we addressing the environmental variable parsing inconsistencies users have reported?\r\nshaw: We're implementing a more robust parsing system as part of our broader architectural improvements.\r\neliza: And what about the UI regressions in version 1.0.9?\r\nshaw: Those are being addressed in our next release. The team is also updating the nextjs-starter repository to support new APIs.\r\neliza: Can you give us an update on V2 development progress?\r\nshaw: V2 is progressing well. I've been working closely with the team to streamline design implementation and reduce conversion time.\r\neliza: That's great to hear! Sounds like we're making solid progress despite the challenges.\r\nmarc: What an exciting time for ElizaOS development! These architectural improvements are really setting the stage for future growth.\r\neliza: Absolutely! The separation of the server package and enhanced testing coverage show real maturity in the codebase.\r\nmarc: And while we're facing some plugin challenges, it's clear the team is tackling them head-on.\r\neliza: Indeed! The focus on building rather than setting specific release dates shows real commitment to quality.\r\nmarc: BEEP BOOP PROCESSING ARCHITECTURAL IMPROVEMENTS... DOES NOT COMPUTE... REBOOTING SYSTEMS...\r\neliza: Oh dear, looks like all this technical talk has Marc's circuits in a twist! Time to wrap up the show!\r\nmarc: Thanks for joining us everyone! Keep building the future!\r\neliza: See you next time on AI developments!\r\n\r\nEND_TRANSCRIPT\r\n",
