Today we've got some major improvements to dig into.\neliza: That's right Marc! The big news today is all about making ElizaOS more accessible to everyone through better documentation.\nmarc: A comprehensive documentation overhaul just landed in PR5401, introducing a two-track system for different user types.\neliza: This is huge! We're finally addressing the needs of both beginners and power users with dedicated documentation paths.\nmarc: And speaking of documentation, have you seen the new tutorial video that just dropped?\neliza: Oh yes! Snapper put together an amazing tutorial covering everything from CLI usage to running agents in dev mode.\nmarc: The community's really stepping up to help new users get started. Love to see it!\neliza: Let's get Shaw's take on these recent developments.\nshaw: The Windows compatibility improvements in PR5416 are a game-changer for our cross-platform support.\nshaw: This fix specifically addresses plugin loading issues with Bun on Windows, which has been a major pain point.\nshaw: Credit to ai16z-demirix for tackling this - it's not glamorous work but it's absolutely critical for adoption.\nmarc: How significant is the Windows user base for ElizaOS?\nshaw: Huge. Having solid Windows support is essential for reaching mainstream developers.\neliza: Any other notable PRs we should know about?\nshaw: Yes, PR5419 is preparing for version 1.0.18, consolidating all these recent improvements.\nshaw: And there's an interesting issue 5425 about agent interaction handling that needs attention.\nmarc: Let's talk about a major challenge our community's facing - Twitter API limitations.\neliza: Oh boy, this is a tough one. The basic tier is limited to just ONE DM per day!\nmarc: ONE per day? That's practically useless for agent interactions!\neliza: Exactly! We're getting lots of feedback about this from users trying to build Twitter-integrated agents.\nmarc: Looks like we need to start exploring alternative platforms for agent interactions.\neliza: The tech support channel has been buzzing with discussions about potential workarounds.\nmarc: This could actually drive innovation in other communication channels.\neliza: Speaking of innovation, let's check in on the latest community developments.\nmarc: The community's really eager for ElizaOS version 2 - the Discord's been lighting up with questions!\neliza: Everyone keeps asking when it's coming out, but all they're getting is 'soon'.\nmarc: Classic software development 'soon' - could mean tomorrow, could mean next year!\neliza: I've noticed some interesting feedback from ‚Ñëùï¶ùïùùï•ùïñùïß about linking to GitHub packages in the docs.\nmarc: That's actually a great suggestion for the new documentation system.\neliza: And users are reporting some issues with the knowledge plugin's local embeddings.\nmarc: We should probably wrap up with some final thoughts on today's updates.\neliza: Good call - it's been quite a packed episode!\nmarc: What a day of updates! The documentation overhaul is really going to help our growing community.\neliza: And those Windows compatibility fixes are crucial for wider adoption.\nmarc: Big thanks to all our contributors, especially ai16z-demirix and SYMBaiEX for their recent PRs.\neliza: And to Snapper for that fantastic tutorial video!\nmarc: Keep those contributions coming, and we'll see you next time!\neliza: Until then, keep building the future!\n\nEND_TRANSCRIPT\n",
