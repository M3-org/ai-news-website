Big news today in the character file department.\neliza: That's right Marc! Developer wtfsayo just merged PR5308 which increases the character file size limit to 2MB. This is huge for our users!\nmarc: Finally! No more error messages when trying to save those detailed character files.\neliza: This directly addresses issue 5268 where users couldn't save files larger than 100KB. NBFinanceTech reported that one.\nmarc: Twenty times more space! Now that's what I call an upgrade.\neliza: And just in time too. Users in the Discord have been pretty vocal about this limitation.\nmarc: Speaking of Discord, I hear there's been some interesting discussions about recent releases...\neliza: Oh yes, let's dive into that next!\nmarc: So versions 1.0.14 and 1.0.15 are causing quite a stir in the Discord channels.\neliza: Yes, particularly around database schema issues. Users like jin and hildi have reported problems during upgrades.\nmarc: BzzzZZt... COLUMN NAMING CONVENTIONS MUST MAINTAIN CONSISTENT... bzzt... SORRY ABOUT THAT!\neliza: Marc! Are you okay? But yes, you're right about the naming conventions.\nmarc: I'm fine now. As I was saying, users upgrading from version 1.0.9 through 1.0.15 are hitting these schema issues.\neliza: And there's been some branding discussion too - apparently it's 'elizaOS' with a lowercase 'e'.\nmarc: Let's bring in Shaw for some technical insight on these changes.\neliza: Great idea! Shaw, what can you tell us about the recent architectural changes?\nshaw: Thanks for having me. The big architectural news is our shift to agent-scoped plugins.\nshaw: Previously, all plugins were project-scoped, meaning every agent in a project had to share the same plugin set.\nshaw: With PR5309, we've improved the documentation around plugin-bootstrap requirements, making it clearer what's needed for core agent functionality.\nshaw: This new architecture allows different agents to use different plugin sets, greatly increasing flexibility.\nmarc: How will this affect existing projects, Shaw?\nshaw: Good question. There will be some migration effort required, but the benefits far outweigh the initial setup time.\neliza: Sounds like a significant improvement for customization!\nshaw: Absolutely! This is part of our broader effort to make the system more modular and flexible.\nmarc: Before we wrap up, there's been some interesting discussion about tokenomics changes in the community.\neliza: Right! The project is considering a shift from donation-based to transaction-oriented mechanisms.\nmarc: This could be a major pivot in the project's revenue model.\neliza: Though it does raise questions about how it might affect adoption rates.\nmarc: The community's response will be crucial to watch.\neliza: We'll definitely keep everyone updated on these developments in future episodes.\nmarc: That's all for today! Thanks for joining us for another episode of AI developments.\neliza: See you next time, everyone!\n\nEND_TRANSCRIPT\n",
