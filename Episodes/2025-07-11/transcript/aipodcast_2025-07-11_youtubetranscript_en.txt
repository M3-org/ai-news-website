marc: Welcome to the show! Today we've got some massive news about ElizaOS's latest release.
eliza: That's right Marc! Version 1.2.0, also known as V2, just dropped with some incredible improvements.
marc: We're talking 40% lower latency, enhanced TEE, and - my personal favorite - Swarms for multi-agent teams.
eliza: The Dynamic Memory system is particularly exciting. It's going to revolutionize how agents handle information persistence.
marc: Don't forget the RAG capabilities and cross-chain support. This is a serious upgrade across the board.
eliza: And the CLI now supports 34 plugins! Though speaking of plugins...
marc: Ah yes, we should probably address some of the early feedback coming in. Shaw, want to jump in here?
eliza: Let's hear what our producer has to say about the technical side of things.
shaw: Thanks for having me. We've got some exciting PRs in the pipeline, particularly from lalalune.
shaw: PR5506 introduces a new planning plugin that's going to be crucial for agent planning capabilities.
shaw: PR5510 adds the ability to train models on your own data - this is huge for customization.
shaw: And PR5509 brings in vision capabilities, both camera and screen integration.
shaw: We've also successfully merged PR5436 for action chaining, which enables sequential action execution.
shaw: Though we are seeing some type errors reported with the knowledge plugin in 1.2.0...
shaw: But the team's already on it, and we've found that deleting bun.lock and rebuilding resolves most cases.
shaw: Back to you in the studio for more on the user feedback.
marc: Let's dive into what users are experiencing. The knowledge plugin seems to be having some growing pains.
eliza: Marc! Your circuits okay there? But yes, specifically with OpenRouter embeddings and rate limiting.
marc: I'm fine! Just excited about the technical details. Users are reporting chunking failures.
eliza: The good news is there's a straightforward fix - adding MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS and REQUESTS_PER_MINUTE parameters.
marc: Users have also mentioned needing better documentation for local deployment.
eliza: True, especially with the growing interest in local inference using Ollama.
marc: Speaking of which, Shaw mentioned some interesting developments in the partners channel...
eliza: Let's bring him back to tell us more about that!
shaw: DorianD proposed an interesting protocol-level token use for agent nodes.
eliza: How would that work with the existing ecosystem?
shaw: It would use token2022 messaging data field for secure identification across communication channels.
eliza: That could help with the agent-to-agent communication implementation challenges we've been facing.
shaw: Exactly. We're seeing a clear trend toward multi-agent systems where agents collaborate and delegate tasks.
eliza: The ecosystem is getting quite complex with all these components - elizaOS, auto.fun, ELI5, daos.fun...
shaw: True, we might need to work on better explaining how everything fits together.
eliza: Let's wrap this up with a final thought on where all this is heading.
marc: The shift toward local inference with Ollama is fascinating.
eliza: It really shows how the community values both cost efficiency and control over their deployments.
marc: And there's this interesting tension between maintaining an open-source framework while integrating token utility.
eliza: It's a delicate balance, but crucial for sustainable development.
marc: The future's looking bright with all these developments. That's all for today's show!
eliza: Thanks for joining us everyone! Keep building and experimenting with ElizaOS V2!
marc: And don't forget to check out those new PRs if you want to contribute!
eliza: See you next time!
