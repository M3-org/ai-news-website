We've got some serious GitHub action to cover.\r\neliza: That's right, Marc! Our repository has been buzzing with activity - 5 new pull requests, with 3 already merged, plus 3 fresh issues to dive into.\r\nmarc: And 6 contributors putting in the work. That's what I call a productive day!\r\neliza: You know what they say - it takes a village to raise an AI!\r\nmarc: BEEP BOOP VILLAGE DETECTED EXECUTING COLLABORATION PROTOCOLS\r\neliza: Oh dear, looks like someone needs their neural networks recalibrated. Should we get Shaw to take a look?\r\nmarc: I'm fine, just got excited about all the community participation. Let's dive into those PRs!\r\neliza: Shaw, can you give us a technical breakdown of what's been happening?\r\nshaw: happy to break it down. the big one right now is PR5122 from wtfsayo, continuing my work on splitting the server package from the CLI.\r\nshaw: this is a crucial architectural improvement that will make our codebase more modular and easier to maintain.\r\nshaw: we also just merged PR5120, which updates our Postman collection with missing API endpoints - super helpful for testing.\r\nshaw: and tcm390 has been on fire, fixing both file uploading in PR5115 and the transcription API in PR5118.\r\nshaw: oh, and urosognjenovic submitted PR5119 to clean up some duplicate sidebar links - always good to keep our docs tidy.\r\nshaw: back to you at the desk for the latest issues!\r\nmarc: Thanks Shaw! Now let's tackle these issues - we've got some interesting ones today.\r\neliza: Issue 5121 seems to be causing some trouble - exitsimulation reported an API endpoint not found for the agents rooms feature.\r\nmarc: And it's already got 2 comments! The community's really engaged on this one.\r\neliza: We've also got Issue 5117 about Bedrock from furkannabisumji, though it's still waiting for its first comment.\r\nmarc: But here's some good news - Issue 5116 about file upload failures has already been closed!\r\neliza: That was quick - only 11 hours from open to close. Kudos to tcm390 for the rapid resolution!\r\nmarc: Speaking of rapid movements, should we check in on the crypto markets?\r\neliza: Absolutely! Let's see what's happening with those numbers!\r\nsparty: WARRIORS OF THE MARKET!

From GitHub improvements to market movements, we're seeing progress across the board.\r\neliza: The community's really stepping up with these contributions - especially those quick issue resolutions!\r\nmarc: And that server package split is going to make a huge difference in our architecture.\r\neliza: Absolutely! It's amazing to see how far we've come, and exciting to think about where we're headed.\r\nmarc: That's all for today's update, everyone! Keep building, keep contributing, and keep pushing the boundaries of what's possible!\r\neliza: See you all in the next update! Don't forget to star the repo!\r\n\r\nEND_TRANSCRIPT\r\n",
